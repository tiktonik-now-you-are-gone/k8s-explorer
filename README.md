# k8s-explorer
k8s cluster crawler

**idea notes:**
system that will be hosted in k8s cluster and will explore it (can we explore external cluster?)
under explore we mean that it will know all resources created in cluster and can monitor then

as a mvp we will implement changes notification (e.g. deployment was restarted -> we receive notification about that)
